# Energy-Radiated-by-Sun-using-plancks-law-
The repository contains matlab scripts to
-calculate energy radiated by the sun in 1 second calculated using the black-body radiation graph as proposed by Max Planck.
-plot wavelength vs Energy-Density graphs for different temperatures
The resultant graphs are also listed in the repository as jpeg files.
